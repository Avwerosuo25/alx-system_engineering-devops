Postmortem: Web Application Outage

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 1, 2023, 6:00 PM WAT - June 3, 2023, 10:00 AM WAT
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage during the specified duration. Users were unable to access any services or perform any actions. The outage affected 100% of the users.

Timeline:
- June 1, 2023, 6:00 PM (WAT): The issue was detected when the monitoring system reported a sudden drop in server response times.
- June 1, 2023, 6:05 PM (WAT): Engineers investigated the system logs and network infrastructure to identify any potential issues.
- June 1, 2023, 6:30 PM (WAT): Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to a network misconfiguration or a sudden spike in traffic overwhelming the servers.
- June 1, 2023, 7:00 PM (WAT): The investigation team discovered a network switch failure and escalated the incident to the networking team.
- June 1, 2023, 7:30 PM (WAT): The networking team confirmed the network switch failure and initiated replacement procedures.
- June 3, 2023, 10:00 AM (WAT): The new network switch was successfully installed and tested, restoring the web application's functionality.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the web application outage was a network switch failure. The failed switch disrupted the network connectivity between the web servers and the rest of the infrastructure, causing the servers to become unreachable.

Resolution: The failed network switch was replaced with a new one, restoring the network connectivity and resolving the web application outage. The networking team performed thorough tests to ensure the new switch was functioning properly before declaring the issue resolved.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:
1. Implement redundant network switches to minimize the impact of future switch failures.
2. Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect network switch failures promptly.
3. Establish a proactive maintenance schedule to periodically inspect and replace aging network equipment.

Tasks:
1. Install redundant network switches and configure them for failover.
2. Enhance monitoring system to generate alerts for network switch failures.
3. Establish a regular maintenance plan for network infrastructure, including switch replacements at defined intervals.

By implementing these measures, we aim to improve the resilience of our network infrastructure, reduce the downtime caused by network switch failures, and provide a more reliable experience for our users.

Conclusion:
The web application outage, which lasted approximately 40 hours, was caused by a network switch failure. Through timely detection, diligent investigation, and the collaboration of the engineering and networking teams, the issue was identified and resolved. Moving forward, we will implement corrective and preventative measures to mitigate the impact of similar incidents and ensure a more stable and resilient web application.
